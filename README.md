# Competitive Programming Solved Problems

Collection of short Python solutions for common LeetCode and competitive programming problems.

## Purpose
- Personal archive of solved problems used for interview practice and algorithm study.

## Structure
- Each Python file implements one problem or little experiments (e.g., `Two Sum -- leetcode.py`).
- Filenames generally indicate the problem name or topic and platform type.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or later.

## How to run
- From this folder, run a single script with Python. Example:

```bash
python Try.py
```

Replace `Try.py` with any other filename to run that solution.

## Notes
- These scripts are intended for learning and may print example outputs when executed.
- If you see issues with a specific script, open the file and run it directly to reproduce the error.

## Contributing
- Add new solved problems as separate `.py` files. Name files clearly (problem-name -- leetcode.py).
- Keep each submission self-contained with example input and a short print-based test harness.
